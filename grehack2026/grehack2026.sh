# Inside them, protobuf is everywhere — and it is opaque: the bytes alone      \

# • Compact binary encoding of structured data — Google's lingua franca:       \
#   RPCs (gRPC), configs, logs, archives.                                      \
#                                                                              \
# • Not self-describing: the bytes carry field numbers and wire types,         \
#   nothing more. No names, no types — a length-delimited field may be a       \
#   string, raw bytes, or a nested message.                                    \
#                                                                              \
# • Decoding needs the schema: a descriptor set (compiled .proto files)        \
#   plus the root message type. Neither travels with the data.                 \
#                                                                              \
# • Generated code usually embeds its descriptors, for reflection — but        \
#   lite builds strip them. Nothing guarantees they are there.                 \
#                                                                              \
# • Decoders are lenient: many encodings decode to the same value, and         \
#   unknown fields pass through silently.                                      \
#                                                                              \
# To read a protobuf you didn't write: recover its schema, and watch what      \
# the decoder lets through. Here is prototools doing both, in a toy            \
# cyber-investigation.                                                         \
