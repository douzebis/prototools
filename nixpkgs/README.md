# nixpkgs staging

The files under `pkgs/` are prototools' nixpkgs packages, laid out as in the
nixpkgs tree (spec 0405):

| Here | In nixpkgs |
|---|---|
| `pkgs/by-name/pr/prototext/package.nix` | same path |
| `pkgs/by-name/pr/protoscan/package.nix` | same path (PR 2, spec 0407; not yet submitted) |

They are what a nixpkgs PR submits, copied verbatim: nixfmt-formatted, with
no SPDX header (their licensing is declared in `REUSE.toml`).

`nix-build -A nixpkgs-staging` builds each staged recipe from the local
tree, through the same `callPackage`, with `src` and the vendored
dependencies taken from here instead of the tag, so its tests and version
check run on today's code. `nix-build -A nixpkgs-staging-check` checks the
formatting and the version: at a release the staged `version` equals the
workspace's (`Cargo.toml`, `workspace.package.version`); between releases
the workspace carries the next version with a `-dev` suffix and the staged
one, which nixpkgs ships, is at most the next release. The check is part
of `ci`; the builds, which compile everything again, run in their own
workflow (`.github/workflows/nixpkgs-staging.yml`) when the recipes or the
dependencies change, and at every release tag.

The other packages (protoscan, the Python extensions, reproto, protolens)
follow one PR at a time, in the order of spec 0405 S9.

`pr-description.md` and `pr-briefing.md` are the notes for the current PR:
its description, and what to be ready to answer in review.

## Releasing

1. In `Cargo.toml`, set `workspace.package.version` and the `version` of
   each internal crate under `workspace.dependencies` to the release; set
   `version` in each `pyproject.toml` (evaluation fails if one disagrees);
   run `cargo update -w`, and `cargo update -p prototext-core` in
   `demo/bobapp` and `grehack2026/game`, which have lock files of their
   own. Add the release's section to `CHANGELOG.md`. Set the same
   `version` in the staged `package.nix` (the check above requires it).
2. Commit, tag `vX.Y.Z`, push the tag to douzebis/prototools; then push
   to ThalesGroup/prototools (spec 0405 C3).
3. nixpkgs, in a checkout of `master`:
   - copy the staged file;
   - `nix-update prototext` (sets `hash` and `cargoHash`);
   - build it, run `nixpkgs-review`, open the PR
     (`prototext: init at X.Y.Z`, then `prototext: A.B.C -> X.Y.Z`).
4. Copy the updated `package.nix` back here (with its `hash` and
   `cargoHash`), and commit.
5. Start the next cycle: as in step 1, with the next version and a `-dev`
   suffix (`0.3.1-dev`), which every `pyproject.toml` spells the PEP 440
   way (`0.3.1.dev0`); add an `[Unreleased]` section to `CHANGELOG.md`;
   commit.
