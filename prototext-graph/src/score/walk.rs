//! Direct scoring walk over the protobuf wire format.
//!
//! Two entry points are provided:
//!
//! - `score(pb, root_state, graph)` — single-entry walk (spec 0042).
//! - `score_all(pb, graph)` — multi-entry parallel walk (spec 0048): scores
//!   all root entries in the compiled graph simultaneously in one traversal.
//!
//! Scoring rules (spec 0042 §3):
//!   Veto    — wire parse error, wire-type/proto-type mismatch on a declared
//!             field, invalid UTF-8 on a string field, varint outside enum
//!             range, invalid packed records, invalid group end, open-ended
//!             group, mismatched group end field number.
//!   Match   — field number present in current state, wire content compatible.
//!   Unknown — field number absent from current state (no schema for field).
//!
//! Non-canonical encodings (overhang bytes on varints, out-of-range field
//! numbers) are noted but do not veto by themselves — they score as match or
//! unknown per the field presence rule, with `non_canonical` incremented so
//! callers can apply a quality penalty.
