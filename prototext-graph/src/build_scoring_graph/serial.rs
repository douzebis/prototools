// ── Data types ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

/// One node (state) in the compiled graph.
///
/// `wire_type`: 0=UINT64, 1=I64, 2=LEN, 3=START_GROUP, 5=I32, 8=UINT32,
/// 9=INT32, 10=MESSAGE.
///
/// 8, 9 and 10 are internal discriminants, not wire types: they say what the
/// state *is*, where the rest say how it is framed. 10 exists because a
/// zero-field message and a `bytes` leaf are otherwise indistinguishable here
/// — both `wire_type: 2, is_string: false, range_idx: 0xFFFF, trans_len: 0` —
/// and the walk must descend into the first and not the second (spec 0324
/// S1/S2). The build knows: Hopcroft seeds messages and leaves from two
/// separate maps and never merges them; only the serialized node forgot.
///
/// `link_transitions` normalizes 10 back to the on-wire 2 for
/// `TransitionEntry::child_wire_type`, which *is* compared against a tag.
///
/// `is_string`: true iff wire_type=2 and a UTF-8 check is required.
///
/// `range_idx`: 0xFFFF = no range (fixed leaf or non-leaf node);
///              otherwise index into `ranges` (RANGE dynamic leaf).
///
/// `ext_range_idx`: 0xFFFF = this state declares no extension ranges, i.e.
///              it is closed; otherwise an index into `ext_range_sets`
///              (spec 0238 S5). Distinct from `range_idx`, which is about
///              legal *values* of a leaf; this is about legal *field
///              numbers* of a message.
///
/// Adding `ext_range_idx` took this struct from 8 bytes to 12: the first
/// four fields pack exactly into 8 at alignment 4, leaving no hole for a
/// fifth. A `u8` index would not have helped — 9 bytes pads to 12 just the
/// same — so the width matches `range_idx` for consistency. The two
/// transition-run fields then take it to 20; on googleapis that is the node
/// table's whole cost, 0.20 MB to 0.33 MB, and it stays comfortably inside
/// L2 where its own binary search lives.
/// `trans_offset`/`trans_len` delimit this state's own run in `transitions`,
/// which is sorted by `(state_id, field_number)` and so holds every edge out
/// of one state contiguously.
///
/// Carrying the run is what lets the walk search *this state's* fields —
/// mean 5.14, median 3 on googleapis — instead of binary-searching the whole
/// 85 806-entry table for every candidate on every tag. The global search
/// was 16.48% of a protolens startup, and it missed cache on most of its ~16
/// probes because the table is 1.37 MB.
///
/// `u32` for the length rather than the `u16` the observed fanout (max 250)
/// would allow: the value is derived from a schema, and a schema is input.
