//! Interned render provenance for `TreeNode::rendered_as` (spec 0213).
//!
//! Held inline, a provenance is an
//! `Option<(Option<Option<String>>, String)>`: 48 bytes plus up to two
//! heap allocations, for the largest field in the node slot and the one
//! least likely to be occupied. On `googleapis.desc` it is empty on
//! 4 499 336 of 4 501 014 nodes — 48 bytes paid 4.5 million times to say
//! "nothing here yet", and paid again for each further copy of the arena
//! a commit holds at its peak. So the value is stored once here and the
//! node holds a 4-byte [`ProvenanceId`] into this table.
//!
//! The whole tuple is interned rather than its parts separately: the type
//! part needs three values that are not a type name — no override,
//! explicit raw, and never rendered — and `FqdnId` has no third sentinel
//! to spare, while the set of distinct tuples is bounded by the overrides
//! in play rather than by nodes.
