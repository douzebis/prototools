//! `popup_wire.rs` is the same job one row down. The difference is the

//! row is already a string in a grammar we own
//! (`docs/prototext/annotation-format.md`), so this lexes the row and

//! the reason the highlighter's spans were not reused (0280 S10).
//!
//! The explanations themselves are not here. They live in
//! `crate::annotation` beside the tiers, so that a keyword reads the
//! same in this box and in the wire box (spec 0285 G2).
