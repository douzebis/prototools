//! Spec 0225: the bytes a drawn line is made of, as one hex row.
//!
//! Two halves. [`App::wire_slice`] answers *which* bytes belong to a
//! line — S2's head/tail partition, S3's wrapper suppression, S4's
//! packed-run walk. [`wire_spans`] answers what they look like: the
//! punctuation of S11, the four-tier palette shared with the `#@`
//! annotation, and the flags of G4.
//!
//! Everything here reads the blob and nothing writes it, so wire mode
//! adds no state to the document model (G5). The parsing is genuinely
//! re-derived rather than read back out of the annotation text, because
//! the annotation carries no byte positions and byte positions are the
//! point.
//!
//! One trap governs the shape of this module: `parse_varint` and
//! `parse_wiretag` report a truncation as "the rest of the buffer",
//! whatever buffer they were handed. Every parse below is therefore run
//! against a slice that stops at the record's own end
//! ([`WireSlice::record_end`]), never against the whole blob — otherwise
//! a perfectly well-formed field would be reported as swallowing the
//! file.
