//! The context menu: a short list drawn at a point, whose every row
//! stands for a key binding that already exists.
//!
//! The menu never *implements* an action. A row carries the `KeyEvent`
//! it is a label for, and activating the row closes the menu and replays
//! that event through `handle_key`. Three things follow from that, and
//! they are the whole reason for the design:
//!
//! - nothing is reachable only by menu, so a terminal that keeps the
//!   right button for itself (see `docs/protolens/input-bindings-review.md`
//!   §6.2) costs the reader discoverability, never capability;
//! - a row cannot drift from the binding it advertises, because it *is*
//!   the binding;
//! - the row's own key works while the menu is open, so using the menu
//!   twice teaches the keystroke that replaces it.
