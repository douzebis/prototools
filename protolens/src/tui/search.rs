//! Spec 0235: a search that answers while it is still being typed.
//!
//! A search here is a *value* rather than a call. `SearchSweep` holds
//! where a walk has got to and what it has found; `App::search_sweep_
//! step` moves it on by a bounded slice and returns the same
//! `Progressed`/`Idle` verdict `prefetch_step` does, because it plugs
//! into the same socket in `run_loop`'s receive loop. That is the whole
//! of how the keyboard stays free during a two-second scan: the sweep
//! never holds the thread for longer than a slice, and abandoning one
//! is a struct assignment rather than a cancellation protocol.
//!
//! The same three panes' searches all run through here, and so do the
//! non-incremental entry points (`n`, `N`, and a `/` confirmed with an
//! empty pattern): those build a sweep, run it to the end in one call,
//! and apply the result. One walk, one matching rule, three callers.
