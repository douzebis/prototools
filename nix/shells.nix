# nix/shells.nix — user-shell and dev-shell definitions.
#
# user-shell: plain shell with prototext, protolens, reproto, protoscan installed.
#             Activated by `nix-shell` (via shell.nix).
#
# dev-shell:  full development environment with Cargo, Rust tools, Python
#             tools, and a structured shellHook.  Activated by
#             `nix-shell dev-shell.nix`.
#
#             The shellHook is structured as named Bash functions called in
#             order, each printing a one-line recap:
#
#               _hook_env        — exports NIXSHELL_REPO, PROTOTEXT_DESCRIPTOR_SET,
#                                  PROTOTEXT_WKT_SET, PROTOTEXT_GOOGLEAPIS_SET,
#                                  PROTOTEXT_GOOGLEAPIS_PBS, PYO3_PYTHON, PATH, PYTHONPATH
#               _hook_python     — writes python.env, pyrightconfig.json, ruff.toml
#               _hook_protos     — compiles fixture .pb descriptors (guarded)
#               _hook_codegen    — runs patch_reproto.sh (guarded)
#               _hook_rust       — exports RUSTFLAGS, TREE_SITTER_TEXTPROTO_*;
#                                  writes rust-toolchain.toml; rustup toolchain
#                                  install
#               _hook_cargo      — cargo build --release -p prototext / -p
#                                  protolens (guarded); runs after _hook_rust
#                                  since protolens's build.rs requires
#                                  TREE_SITTER_TEXTPROTO_LIB_DIR/QUERIES_DIR
#               _hook_man        — generates man pages into man/man1/
#               _hook_nvim       — writes .nvim/nvim/init.lua (desert + proto
#                                  LSP via buf); exports XDG_CONFIG_HOME
