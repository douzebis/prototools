# Pane: main pane

*last verified: 2026-07-16*

## Executive summary

The main pane is the single scrollable view of the whole document tree —
the pane every other pane is a satellite of. Its job is threefold: let the
user move a cursor around the document tree in a way that matches how a
human actually thinks about the structure (next/previous sibling, into/out
of a container, not just "next line of text"); let them fold away
uninteresting subtrees; and render each visible line with syntax
highlighting and, where relevant, a visual cue that an override is in
effect. None of this pane's own code decides *what* to render — that's the
[document tree](document-tree.md)'s and the
[override collection](override-collection.md)'s job; the main pane only
decides *which* of the tree's already-rendered lines are currently on
screen and how to draw them.

## Technical detail

### Movement follows document order, not array order

Because the tree's array is post-order (see
[document-tree.md](document-tree.md)), every "next"/"previous" movement
walks the explicit `doc_next`/`doc_prev` chain, never `index + 1`. Two
distinct movement granularities exist side by side: plain
document-order stepping (`j`/`k`), which passes through every visible
descendant of a container before reaching its next sibling, and
sibling-skip movement (`J`/`K`), which jumps directly to the next/previous
node sharing the same parent — the more useful move once a subtree has
already been inspected once. Both respect fold state identically: a
folded node's descendants are simply never visited by either.

### Fold state is a `HashSet`, visibility is derived

Folding doesn't remove or hide anything in the tree itself — it only adds
a node's index to a `folded` set. A separate "visible rows" list is
recomputed from that set (and only from that set, not on every frame)
whenever fold state actually changes; the render loop always draws from
this precomputed list rather than re-deriving visibility per frame. A
node's own opening line stays visible even when it's folded (with a fold
marker and a truncated "one-line summary" of its contents), which is what
keeps the fold-indicator gutter meaningful — folding a node changes how
much of *its own* line is shown, never whether it appears at all.

### Selection, copy, and the double-click distinction

Mouse-driven line selection (click, drag, release) and cursor movement
are tracked independently: a selection never moves the cursor, and moving
the cursor never touches an active selection. This independence exists
because a selection's purpose (marking a range of *text* to copy) and the
cursor's purpose (marking the *node* the rest of the UI acts on) are
genuinely different operations that a user may want to combine — e.g.
selecting several lines while the cursor stays on an earlier node whose
override is still being decided.

Copying is a single, explicit, always-available action (`Ctrl-C`) rather
than tied to mouse release, because terminal mouse-release events are
ambiguous by nature: crossterm cannot distinguish a single click from the
first half of a double-click at the protocol level, so protolens
disambiguates them itself (comparing consecutive click timestamps and
positions) purely to decide whether a plain click should clear an
existing selection or a double-click should preserve one — a decision
that has nothing to do with when the actual clipboard write happens.
`Ctrl-C` with no active selection falls back to the cursor's current
line, so the key is always meaningful, never a silent no-op.

Clipboard access itself degrades gracefully: an OS clipboard write
(`arboard`) is attempted first, and an OSC 52 terminal escape sequence is
always emitted as a fallback whenever it fails — the common case being a
plain SSH session with no X11/Wayland provider available. Because OSC 52
has no acknowledgment protocol, the UI can never distinguish "the
terminal actually honored it" from "the terminal silently ignored it," so
the status message is deliberately optimistic rather than trying to
report a definitive success/failure.

### Syntax highlighting is a display transform over already-rendered text

The main pane doesn't highlight *data* — it highlights protolens's own
already-rendered `#@`-annotated textproto output, using a tree-sitter
grammar for that same textproto syntax. This means highlighting is
entirely decoupled from the decode/override pipeline: any text protolens
can render, it can highlight, with no per-override-kind special-casing
needed in the highlighter itself. See `colorize.rs`/`theme.rs` for the
highlighting pipeline's own internal structure, which this pane consumes
via `render_line_spans` without needing to know how the roles were
computed.
