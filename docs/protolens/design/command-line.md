# Pane: command line (global command/message row)

*last verified: 2026-07-19*

## Executive summary

There is exactly one text-entry surface in protolens — a single
`Length(1)` row fixed at the very bottom of the whole screen, shared
across every pane regardless of how many are open — and every pane that
needs to prompt for typed input (ex-commands, searches, the management
pane's rename) shares it rather than growing its own. This same row also
carries a passive `self.message` notice whenever no text entry is
active, so it is never idle-blank except when there is genuinely nothing
to show. What the row currently represents (a `:` command, a `/`/`?`
search, a rename, or a message) is tracked by trying each source in a
fixed priority order each frame; the buffer's own editing model (cursor
position, insert/delete, Tab-completion) is written once and is
identical regardless of which of the first three is currently being
typed. This row never shows any pane's own cursor/position info — that
lives in each pane's own local statusline instead (see
[help-and-chrome.md](help-and-chrome.md)).

## Technical detail

### One buffer, one cursor model, several interpretations

The shared buffer is edited with a real character-index cursor (not
"always append at the end") — `Left`/`Right`/`Home`/`End` move it,
`Backspace`/`Delete`/typed characters act relative to it — because a user
correcting a typo mid-command shouldn't need to retype everything after
it. `Enter`'s behavior branches only at the very last moment, on which
`CommandLineKind` is currently active and which pane currently has
focus: an ex-command is parsed and dispatched; a search pattern is
handed to whichever pane's own search function is appropriate (main pane,
override-select pane, or management pane — determined by focus, not by
anything stored in the search state itself). An empty `/`/`?` confirmation
reuses the last pattern *for that specific pane*, mirroring vim's own
convention, while `n` always repeats in the same direction the pattern
was last searched, independent of which direction a fresh `/`/`?` press
might currently be requesting.

### Command dispatch: one registry, two consumers

Every ex-command name is declared exactly once, in a single array
constant. That one list is the source of truth for both prefix-matching
dispatch (a user can type an unambiguous prefix of a command name and
have it resolve, with an *exact* full-name match always taking priority
over being a prefix of something longer — matching how both vim's
`:command` abbreviations and `argparse` resolve prefixes) and Tab
completion's candidate list. Adding a new ex-command is a one-line
addition to that array; both dispatch and completion pick it up
automatically, with no second registration point to remember.

### Tab-completion: token-aware, not just command-name

Completion isn't limited to command names. Once the first token has
unambiguously resolved to a command that takes a particular kind of
argument, the *second* token is completed against that argument's own
domain: `type-as`'s argument completes against the session's full list of
known type FQDNs; `save-overrides`/`restore-overrides`'s argument
completes against the filesystem, directory by directory, the same way a
shell's own path completion works (each Tab descends one more directory
level rather than trying to complete the whole remaining path at once).
Every other command, and every position past a command's single
expected argument, is a silent no-op — deliberately, since guessing at
what a not-yet-designed future argument might mean would be worse than
doing nothing.

Repeated `Tab` presses cycle through the current candidate list once
completion is already active; the first press instead extends the
in-progress token to the longest common prefix of all candidates (vim/zsh
convention) without yet committing to any one of them, so a user typing
`ty` and pressing Tab once sees `type-as` (or, if `type-as-raid` existed
too, whatever their common prefix is) without the pane guessing which one
was meant.
