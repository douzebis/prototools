# 0113 — `protolens` TUI refinements (living record)

**Status:** living / in progress
**Refs:** `docs/specs/0111-protolens-v1-decode-navigate-extract.md`,
`docs/specs/0114-protolens-range-type-override.md`
**App:** protolens

---

## Background

Spec 0111 defines `protolens` v1's committed scope (decode/navigate/extract)
and its Annex B/C key-binding and layout *proposal*. As v1 gets exercised
interactively, small UX/behavioral decisions accumulate faster than they'd
naturally fit as edits to 0111's Annexes without losing the thread of *why*
each one was made. This spec is a **living record** of those decisions: each
entry below is a concrete point raised during interactive testing, the
decision made, and (where relevant) the implementation note. It is expected
to keep growing as testing continues — new entries are appended, not
squeezed retroactively into 0111.

This spec does not restate or supersede 0111's committed Goals/Specification;
it only refines *how* v1 behaves within that scope, or corrects points where
implementation revealed 0111's assumptions were wrong.

### How this spec is organized

- **Index** (below): every entry as a GFM task-list checkbox (`[x]`
  implemented, `[ ]` deferred or open), grouped by category for quick
  scanning. Each line links to its full entry in "Decisions."
- **Decisions**: full entries, in stable `D<n>` order (`n` is assigned once,
  at creation, and never reused/renumbered — safe to reference `D7` from a
  commit message or another doc). Each entry carries an explicit
  `**Status:**` line: `Implemented`, `Deferred` (future phase, not
  actionable yet), or `Open` (decision not yet made — implementation
  pending discussion).
- New feedback: append a new `D<n>` under the right category in the index,
  then a full entry in `D<n>` order at the end of "Decisions." Don't
  renumber or reorder existing entries.

## Decisions

### D1 — `NodeSpan` emission order is post-order, not pre-order

**Status:** Implemented

0111's "Tree construction (ingestion)" section assumed
`IndexingTextSink` hands back `Vec<NodeSpan>` in pre-order/document order.
Reading `IndexingTextSink::begin_nested`/`end_nested`
(`prototext-core/src/serialize/render_text/sink.rs`) shows a container's own
`NodeSpan` is only pushed in `end_nested` — i.e. *after* all of its
descendants have already pushed theirs. The vec is **post-order**: children
before their own parent. Leaves (`scalar_field`) are pushed immediately on
visitation.

- `protolens/src/decode.rs`'s `build_tree()` was rewritten for post-order
  input: for each incoming node `i` at `level`, pop every stack entry with a
  strictly greater level as one of `i`'s children (already fully built,
  post-order guarantees this); the (now topmost) remaining entry, if at the
  same level, is `i`'s immediate previous sibling.
- `TreeNode` gained an explicit `doc_next`/`doc_prev` document-order chain
  (sorted once by `raw_range.start`), since post-order array-index
  arithmetic no longer gives document order "for free" the way 0111
  originally assumed. `j`/`k`/mouse-wheel movement and `App::new()`'s
  initial cursor placement (`doc_prev.is_none()`) now use this chain
  instead of raw index arithmetic.
- 0111's own §1 pseudo-code / prose describing `TreeNode` construction is
  now stale on this point; not edited in place (per this spec's
  living-record approach) — this entry is the correction of record.

### D2 — All panes bordered; shared border between adjacent panes

**Status:** Implemented

Initial layout only bordered the main pane. Decision: all four regions
(header, main, status, command/message) get a border, but adjacent panes
share their separating line rather than drawing two adjacent border rows.

- Header uses `Block::bordered()` (all four sides).
- Main/status/command panes use
  `Block::default().borders(Borders::LEFT | Borders::RIGHT | Borders::BOTTOM)`
  (no `TOP`) — each pane's content starts exactly where the previous pane's
  bottom border row ended.
- Layout constraints: `[Length(3), Min(0), Length(2), Length(2)]` for
  header/main/status/command respectively.

### D3 — Fold marker indentation

**Status:** Implemented

Initial rendering prepended a fixed-width 2-column gutter (`▸`/`▾` or
blank) flush-left on every line, ahead of the rendered text's own
indentation. Decision: the marker should visually align with the node's
nesting depth instead of always sitting at column 0.

- `render_line_content()` splices the marker into the *last character of
  the line's own existing leading whitespace* rather than prepending a
  separate gutter column. A level-0 node (no leading whitespace) falls back
  to `"{marker} {content}"`.
- `marker_column()` (free function) computes the same column for mouse
  hit-testing (`indent_len.saturating_sub(1)`).

### D4 — Mouse support (wheel + click)

**Status:** Implemented

Decision: add mouse as a partial alternate input, per 0111 Annex A's choice
of `crossterm` (which already carries mouse events independently of
`ratatui`, which is stateless/immediate-mode and has no built-in focus
concept — "focus," where it matters, is ordinary app-level state, not
something `ratatui` manages itself).

- `run()` enables mouse capture (`EnableMouseCapture`/`DisableMouseCapture`
  around the terminal session).
- Wheel scroll dispatches to the same `move_down()`/`move_up()` helpers used
  by `j`/`k` (movement logic factored out of the key handler for reuse).
- Left-click hit-tests against a cached `main_area: Rect` (updated each
  `render()` call): resolves the clicked row to a tree node via
  `visible_rows`/`line_to_node`, moves the cursor there (recording a
  jumplist entry if the node changed, per 0111 Annex B's "explicit go-to"
  jumplist rule), and if the click column equals `marker_column(...)` on a
  foldable node, toggles its fold via `toggle_fold()` (also factored out of
  the keyboard fold bindings for reuse).
- v1 has no split panes yet, so there's no real focus ambiguity to resolve
  today; this factoring (app state vs. rendering) is expected to extend
  cleanly once Phase 3/5 panes (0111) land.
- **Trade-off surfaced by D14**: enabling `EnableMouseCapture` also disables
  the terminal emulator's own click-drag text selection (all mouse events
  are forwarded to the app instead) — see D14.

### D5 — Configurable indent step

**Status:** Implemented

`DecodeRenderOpts::indent_size` (from `prototext-core`) defaults to `1`,
too small for comfortable nesting in the TUI. Decision: add a `--indent`
CLI flag, default `2`.

- `Cli::indent: usize`, `#[arg(long = "indent", default_value_t = 2)]`
  (`protolens/src/main.rs`).
- `decode::decode()` takes an `indent_size: usize` parameter, threaded into
  `DecodeRenderOpts`.

### D6 — Folded-line display: closing brace before trailing content

**Status:** Implemented

A folded container line originally rendered as e.g. `message { #@ foo`
(with no visible closing brace at all). Decision: show
`message { ... } #@ foo` instead — the fold summary (`... }`) inserted
immediately after the node's own opening `{`, before any trailing
content/annotation, so the elision is visually self-contained rather than
implying the line simply never closes.

- `render_line_content()`: when the node is folded, finds the *last* `{` in
  the marker-spliced line (`.rfind('{')`) and inserts `" ... }"` right
  after it; falls back to appending at the end if no `{` is found (robust
  to any future trailing-annotation text).

### D7 — Groups are foldable, same as messages (no special-casing needed)

**Status:** Implemented

Question raised: can proto2 GROUP fields be folded/unfolded like messages,
or does their different wire encoding complicate this? Checked
`render_group_field` (`prototext-core/src/serialize/render_text/helpers/
len_field.rs`): it calls `sink.begin_nested(..., NestedKind::Group, ...)`/
`sink.end_nested(...)` exactly like a regular nested message field
(`NestedKind::Message`) — the only difference is the `NestedKind` tag and
that a group has no length prefix (`raw_start`'s frame isn't reset).
`NodeSpan` itself carries no `NestedKind`/kind distinction, and
`protolens`'s `TreeNode`/`has_children()` (`first_child.is_some()`) is
purely structural — it doesn't care what produced the nesting. **Decision:
no implementation change needed** — groups already fold/unfold correctly
today, for free, because they already produce a first-class
`begin_nested`/`end_nested` subtree in the index like any other container.

### D8 — Folding then unfolding a node must not mutate descendants' fold state

**Status:** Implemented

Requirement (already true of the current implementation — recorded here so
it doesn't regress): fold state is tracked per-node (`App::folded:
HashSet<usize>`), one independent bit per node. Folding a node only hides
its descendants' *rows* (via `rebuild_visible_rows`'s
`text_range`-derived hidden-range computation); it never touches
`folded`'s membership for any node other than the one toggled. So folding a
container, then unfolding it again, always restores its subtree exactly as
it was — any descendant that was independently folded stays folded, any
that was expanded stays expanded. `toggle_fold()` (D4) only ever inserts/
removes the single toggled index from `folded`, confirming this holds
going forward as well.

### D9 — Folded/unfolded node list belongs in the saved project config (future)

**Status:** Deferred (0111 Phase 7)

Noted for later, once 0111 Phase 7's project-file format
("Project file and batch mode" in 0111's "Beyond v1") is designed: the
current fold set (`App::folded: HashSet<usize>`, or a range-keyed
equivalent stable across re-decodes) should be part of the saved project
YAML, alongside the overriding collection, so reopening a project restores
the same view, not just the same interpretation. Not actionable yet — v1
has no project file at all (0111 Non-goals) — recorded here so it isn't
lost by the time Phase 7 starts.

### D10 — `--no-annotations` CLI flag

**Status:** Implemented

`prototext`'s own `decode` subcommand already ships `--no-annotations`
(annotations *on* by default — `prototext/src/lib.rs`). `protolens`
previously hard-coded `annotations: false` in `decode.rs`, diverging from
that convention and from the fact that annotations (wire type, field decl,
modifiers) are important context when eyeballing unknown/mismatched wire
data to guess its real type — exactly `protolens`'s use case. Decision:
match `prototext`'s convention — annotations on by default, `--no-annotations`
to suppress them.

- `Cli::no_annotations: bool`, `#[arg(long = "no-annotations")]`
  (`protolens/src/main.rs`).
- `decode::decode()` takes an `annotations: bool` parameter (`main.rs`
  passes `!cli.no_annotations`), threaded into `DecodeRenderOpts`.

### D11 — Fold/unfold state must be transparent to extraction

**Status:** Implemented (as a constraint — `extract.rs` itself not yet built)

Design invariant, flagged ahead of `extract.rs`'s implementation (not yet
built): fold/unfold is purely cosmetic UI state (`App::folded:
HashSet<usize>`) and must have **zero effect** on `extract`'s output.
Extraction always operates on the underlying `NodeSpan::raw_range` (or
`text_range` for the `#@ prototext` format, per 0111 Open Issue 2) against
the original blob/rendered text — never against the currently-folded
on-screen view. Reaffirms 0111's existing "fold state is pure UI state, not
part of the index/undo model" principle (0111 §2), called out here
specifically as a constraint `extract.rs` must honor when implemented.

### D12 — D6's `... }` splice verified against real annotated output

**Status:** Implemented (verified, no change needed)

Question raised once annotations went on by default (D10): does D6's
`render_line_content` fold-brace splice (`s.rfind('{')` + insert
`" ... }"` right after it) still land correctly now that the header line
also carries a trailing `#@ ...` annotation? Checked both statically and
by round-tripping `decode()` against a real self-describing descriptor set
(`prototext-core/fixtures/descriptor.pb`, decoded as
`google.protobuf.FileDescriptorSet` with `annotations: true`): every
container's own header line (`wob_prefix_n`/`begin_virtual_nested`/the
`NestedKind::Group` branch, all in `prototext-core/src/serialize/
render_text/{sink.rs,helpers/output.rs}`) writes its `{` exactly once,
with any `#@ ...` annotation text appended strictly *after* it, on the same
line, before the newline — and no annotation token (`field_decl`,
`TYPE_MISMATCH`, `tag_ohb: N`, `[packed=true]`, etc.) ever itself contains
a `{` character. So `rfind('{')` reliably finds the node's own opening
brace regardless of annotation content, e.g.:

```
"    field {  #@ repeated FieldDescriptorProto = 2"       (unfolded)
"   ▸field { ... }  #@ repeated FieldDescriptorProto = 2"  (folded)
```

**Decision: no code change needed** — D6's implementation already composes
correctly with annotations on. Recorded here since it was flagged as a
concern worth double-checking, not because a bug was found.

### D13 — Raw-range status-line display: inclusive bound

**Status:** Implemented

The status line showed `bytes[121..232]` using `raw_range`'s own
half-open-range values as-is — misleading, since it reads like an
inclusive range (`[start..end]`) while actually meaning `[start..end)`.
Decision: display an inclusive bound instead — `bytes[121..231]` — judged
easier to read at a glance than spelling out `[121..232)`.

- `render()`'s status-line `format!`: `node.raw_range.end` →
  `node.raw_range.end.saturating_sub(1)` (display-only; `NodeSpan` itself,
  and everything derived from it, e.g. future `extract.rs`, keeps using the
  half-open `raw_range` unchanged).

### D14 — Mouse-driven text selection for copy

**Status:** Implemented (documentation-only — no code change)

D4's `EnableMouseCapture` forwards *all* mouse events to `protolens`,
which means the terminal emulator's own click-drag text selection no
longer engages by default — a real regression for "just copy this line to
paste elsewhere," which worked for free before D4. Three options were
considered, not mutually exclusive:

1. **Already works today, zero code**: nearly every terminal emulator
   (xterm, GNOME Terminal/VTE, Kitty, Alacritty, iTerm2, Windows Terminal,
   WezTerm) supports holding **Shift while dragging** to bypass an app's
   mouse-capture request and fall back to the terminal's own native
   selection — a terminal-level convention, not something `protolens`
   implements or can break.
2. **App-level "visual selection" mode** (vim-style): a key (e.g. `v`)
   enters a line/range-selection mode; existing cursor movement
   (`j`/`k`/click) extends the selection; a key (e.g. `y`) yanks it.
   Copies via an OSC 52 escape sequence (`\x1b]52;c;<base64>\x07`) written
   directly to the terminal — no GUI clipboard binding needed on the Rust
   side (so no new platform-specific dependency, works over SSH), though
   some terminals/multiplexers require enabling it (e.g. `tmux set -g
   set-clipboard on`). Keyboard-driven, so it works even without a mouse.
3. **Mouse-driven drag-select**: `MouseEventKind::Down(Left)` sets a
   selection anchor, `Drag(Left)` extends it, `Up(Left)` finalizes and
   copies (same OSC 52 mechanism as option 2) — closer to "the mouse
   selection users expect," but more event-handling surface (multi-line
   selection rendering/highlighting, anchor bookkeeping) than option 2.

**Decision: option 1, zero code.** Shift+drag already restores native
terminal selection with no `protolens` changes. Options 2/3 remain
available to revisit later if Shift+drag proves insufficient in practice
(e.g. over some remote/multiplexer setup where it's unavailable), but
aren't needed now. Worth documenting in a future `?` help overlay (0111
Annex C) rather than assuming it's discoverable.

### D15 — Page Up/Down; fold-all/unfold-all siblings

**Status:** Implemented

Two related gaps: no page-wise scrolling, and no single keystroke to
fold/unfold every sibling of the cursor node at once (previously only
one-at-a-time via `z`/`Space`/click).

- `KeyCode::PageDown`/`PageUp`: repeats `move_down()`/`move_up()`
  `self.main_area.height` times (`move_page_down()`/`move_page_up()`) —
  reuses D4's existing single-step movement rather than a separate
  scroll-offset jump, so it inherits the same hidden-node-skipping
  (`next_visible`/`prev_visible`) behavior for free.
- `H`: fold every sibling of the cursor node that has children
  (`fold_all_siblings()`).
- `Shift-Right`: unfold every sibling of the cursor node
  (`unfold_all_siblings()`). Bound as `KeyCode::Right` guarded by
  `key.modifiers.contains(KeyModifiers::SHIFT)`, checked *before* the
  existing unguarded `l`/`Right` child-move arm in the `match` (guard
  ordering matters: an unguarded `Right` arm placed first would shadow
  it).
- Both new fold commands share a `sibling_range(idx)` helper: walk to the
  first sibling via `prev_sibling`, then collect forward via
  `next_sibling`. This works uniformly at any level, including root-level
  nodes, which are linked to each other via `next_sibling`/`prev_sibling`
  despite having no `parent` (`build_tree`'s stack-based algorithm sets
  sibling links independently of parent assignment) — see D16.

### D16 — At the root, `h`/`H` fold the whole root level

**Status:** Implemented

Previously, `h`/`Left` at a root-level node (no `parent` to move to)
printed "already at root" and did nothing. Decision: since D15's
`sibling_range`/`fold_all_siblings` already work at the root (root-level
nodes are sibling-linked to each other), reuse that instead of a no-op —
`h`/`Left`'s "no parent" fallback now calls `fold_all_siblings()`, the same
action `H` performs everywhere. No special-casing needed: root-level fold
is just `H`'s general "fold all siblings at this level" applied to the
level that happens to have no parent.

### D17 — `Shift-Left` as an alias for `H`

**Status:** Implemented

`H` (D15, fold-all-siblings) had no arrow-key alias, unlike `Shift-Right`
(unfold-all-siblings). Decision: add `Shift-Left` as an alias, mirroring
`Shift-Right`'s guard/placement — `KeyCode::Left` guarded by
`key.modifiers.contains(KeyModifiers::SHIFT)`, checked before the
unguarded `h`/`Left` parent-move/fold arm.

### D18 — `l`/`Right` made symmetric with `h`/`Left` (ARIA tree-view pattern)

**Status:** Implemented

Reported inconsistency: `l`/`Right` on a closed foldable node unfolded it
*and* jumped straight to its first child in one press, but a second press
then tried to descend into that child's own children instead of advancing
to the second child — surprising, since the two presses did visibly
different kinds of things. Researched the
[W3C WAI-ARIA Tree View Pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/treeview/),
the closest thing to a standard keyboard-interaction spec for tree
widgets: it explicitly decouples *open* from *move-to-child* — Right Arrow
on a closed node opens it with focus staying put; only a Right Arrow on an
already-open node moves focus to the first child. `h`/`Left` already had
this two-step shape (close-if-open first; move-to-parent only if already
closed/leaf) — `l`/`Right` didn't.

- `l`/`Right`'s handler now checks `folded.contains(&cursor)` first: if
  the cursor is on a closed foldable node, it only opens it
  (`toggle_fold`), cursor unchanged; only when the node has no children,
  or is already open, does it move to `first_child` (recording a
  jumplist entry, as before).
- This makes `l`/`l` and `h`/`h` symmetric: first press affects fold
  state only, second press moves the cursor — matching the ARIA standard
  and eliminating the reported inconsistency.

### D19 — `Home`/`End` and `gg`/`G` jump-to-first/last-visible-node

**Status:** Implemented

Gap flagged during review: no way to jump directly to the first/last node
without repeated `j`/`k`/PageDown — a conventional gap versus `less`,
file managers, and vim's own `gg`/`G`. Decision: add both a direct-key and
a vim-chord binding for the same two actions, since both are widely
idiomatic and neither conflicts with existing bindings.

- `Home` / `gg` (two `g` presses in a row — `App::pending_g`, cleared by
  any other key) → `move_home()`: jump to the document-order first node
  (`App::first_node`, computed once in `App::new()`, same node the cursor
  starts on).
- `End` / `G` → `move_end()`: jump to the document's absolute last node
  (`last_node()`, following `doc_next` to the end), or its nearest
  visible predecessor (`prev_visible`) if that last node is itself
  folded away — respects fold state, like PageUp/PageDown (D15) already
  do.
- Both record a jumplist entry (`record_jump`) when they actually move
  the cursor, consistent with the "explicit go-to" jumplist rule (0111
  Annex B) already applied to sibling-skip (`J`/`K`), parent/child move,
  and mouse click.
- Not proposed/added: vim's Ctrl-D/Ctrl-U (half-page) or Ctrl-F/Ctrl-B
  (full-page) — PageUp/PageDown (D15) already cover that ground; aliasing
  the same action under more keys wasn't resolving any reported gap.

### D20 — Future: user-configurable keybindings file

**Status:** Deferred (no action until a real layout collision is reported)

Raised during review (user has a French-Macintosh keyboard layout):
should keybindings be configurable per keyboard layout? Researched two
angles:

- **Physical-layout independence at the terminal-protocol level**: the
  Kitty keyboard protocol's "base-layout-key" (`report_alternates`)
  enhancement lets a terminal report the *physical* key identity
  independent of the active OS layout. Not usable today: `crossterm`
  (0111 Annex A's terminal dependency) doesn't yet implement this part of
  the protocol (open upstream issue,
  crossterm-rs/crossterm#968).
- **AZERTY-safety of the current binding set**: `h`/`j`/`k`/`l`/`z`/`x`/
  `q`/`H`/`J`/`K`/`g`/`G` all sit at the same physical/character position
  on AZERTY as QWERTY — the "vim hjkl problem" doesn't actually apply to
  these letters. AZERTY friction is concentrated elsewhere (top-left
  letter swap, `M` relocation, digit row defaults) — none of which
  `protolens` currently binds. **No known collision exists today.**
- **Practical fallback used by mature tools**: Helix (TOML,
  `~/.config/helix/config.toml`) and lazygit (YAML, `config.yml`) both
  solve layout/preference portability by shipping sane defaults *and*
  making every binding user-remappable via a config file, rather than
  trying to be layout-aware themselves.

**Decision:** don't build a keybindings config file speculatively — no
actual collision has been reported, and the AZERTY letters we use are
unaffected. If a real collision surfaces later, the Helix/lazygit
config-file-remapping model is the recommended path (not a bespoke
scheme). Recorded here so it isn't re-researched from scratch if/when it
becomes actionable.

### D21 — Extract command line: `x` and `:extract`

**Status:** Implemented

0111 Goal 4 (extract) had no `extract.rs` and no working `x` binding
(stub message only). Decision, resolving 0111 §2's "exact binding TBD":
support both forms 0111 sketched, rather than picking one — `x` as a
shortcut, `:extract` as the general form, vim-style (0111 Annex C already
frames the command/message line as vim-style, hosting `:extract <path>`-
style ex-commands).

- `App::command_buffer: Option<String>` — `Some(buffer)` while a command
  line is being edited, `None` in normal navigation mode;
  `handle_key`/`handle_mouse` fully defer to `handle_command_key` while
  it's `Some`, so command-line text doesn't leak into normal-mode
  bindings.
- `:` opens an empty command line; `x` is a shortcut that pre-fills it
  with `extract <default path>` (see D23) — both land in the same
  `command_buffer`/`handle_command_key`/`run_command` machinery.
- `Enter` executes (`run_command` → `run_extract`), `Esc` cancels,
  `Backspace` on an empty buffer also cancels (matches vim's own command
  line), any other character is appended.
- `extract.rs` (new file): `extract_binary()` (raw byte sub-slice of
  `raw_range`), `dedent()` (Python-`textwrap.dedent()`-style common-
  leading-whitespace strip, resolving 0111 Open Issue 2's "extracted
  `#@ prototext` snippet must be self-contained" requirement), and
  `extract()` (writes one or the other to a file). Covered by
  `#[cfg(test)]` unit tests per 0111 §4's "pure-logic unit tests" bullet.
- `run_extract` parses `extract [--binary|--text] <path>` — no quoting/
  escaping grammar, `path` is just the remaining whitespace-joined
  tokens; default format is text (see D23's sibling default-format
  decision, made together with this entry).
- No file-navigator popup: mimics vim's own `:w <path>` — a typed path on
  the command line, no built-in file browser (that's a plugin concern in
  vim, e.g. netrw/fzf, not core `:w` behavior) — consistent with keeping
  v1's command line minimal.

### D22 — Help overlay and startup splash screen

**Status:** Implemented

0111 Annex C already anticipated a `?` help overlay ("cheap enough to
ship in v1 itself") but it was never built; separately, a first-time user
has no in-app hint that help exists at all. Decision: build both.

Later amended (spec 0114, main-pane search): `?` was reassigned to
in-pane search (`/`/`?`/`n`, extended from the override pane to the main
pane), so the help overlay moved to `F1` instead.

- `HELP_TEXT: &[&str]` — a static, hand-phrased key-binding reference
  (grouped: Movement, Fold/unfold, Navigation history, Extract, Other),
  kept as flat text rather than generated from `handle_key`'s match arms
  so it can be organized for readability independent of match-arm order.
- `F1` toggles `App::help_open`; while open, `handle_key` defers to
  `handle_help_key`: `j`/`k`/`Down`/`Up` scroll one line,
  `PageDown`/`PageUp` scroll by 10, `q`/`Esc`/`F1` closes. `help_scroll`
  is clamped against the popup's actual rendered height in `render_help`
  (content length vs. `inner.height`), not against a fixed constant.
- `App::splash: bool`, `true` from `App::new()`; the very first keypress
  both clears it *and* is processed as a real command (transparent to
  keyboard input — spec 0114 amendment), same as if there had been no
  splash screen at all. Shows the same header line as the main header
  pane plus "Press F1 for help." / "Press any key to continue.".
- Both render as a centered modal via a new `centered_rect()` free
  function (the standard ratatui popup-centering recipe: nested
  `Percentage`-based vertical then horizontal `Layout` split) plus
  `Clear` (ratatui's "erase what's behind a popup" widget) before drawing
  the modal's own `Block`/`Paragraph` — drawn *after* the normal 4-region
  layout in `render()`, so the full UI is always laid out underneath.

### D23 — Extract default-path proposal

**Status:** Implemented

Typing a full path by hand for every extract is friction, especially
since the two most useful identifying facts about a node (its byte range,
its type) are already on screen (status line). Decision: `x` pre-fills
the command line with a proposed default path instead of leaving it
blank — the user can accept it (just press `Enter`) or overwrite/edit it
before confirming.

- Format: `<blob_stem>.<raw_start>-<raw_end>.<short_type>.pb` — e.g.
  extracting a `DescriptorProto` at byte range `[212..8841]` out of
  `descriptor.pb` proposes `descriptor.212-8841.DescriptorProto.pb`.
  `<blob_stem>` is the original blob's filename without extension
  (`blob_path.file_stem()`); `<short_type>` is the type FQDN's last
  `.`-segment (falls back to `"node"` if the node has no resolved type,
  e.g. an unknown/malformed field). The byte range ties the filename back
  to the status line's `bytes[..]` display and keeps repeated extracts
  from the same session collision-free; the short type name adds
  readability without the noise of a fully-qualified name in every
  filename.
- Always a `.pb` extension, regardless of format (`--binary` or the
  default `--text`): both are "a protobuf-shaped payload" in the sense
  that matters for this naming scheme (round-trippable via `prototext
  decode`/`prototext encode`), so the extension shouldn't encode which
  representation was chosen — that's what `--binary`/`--text` on the
  command itself already records, redundantly encoding it in the
  filename would just be one more thing that can drift out of sync if
  the file is renamed.
- Default format (independent question, decided together with this
  entry): `#@ prototext` text, not raw binary — carries more of the
  payload's inferred structure than opaque bytes, and is always
  reconstructible back to binary via `prototext encode`, whereas the
  reverse (bytes → structure) is exactly the hypothesis-testing problem
  `protolens` exists to help with. `--binary` opts into raw bytes when
  that's specifically what's needed (e.g. feeding a sub-blob to another
  tool's own `--type` guess, 0111 Goal 4's original framing).
- Implemented as `App::default_extract_path()`, called once when `x` is
  pressed (not recomputed as the user edits the pre-filled buffer).

### D24 — Horizontal panning of the main pane

**Status:** Open — key bindings agreed; pan step size and clamping/gutter
interaction still TBD at implementation time.

Gap: long field values (and, once spec 0114 lands, an override's re-spliced
subtree at extra indentation depth) can already exceed the main pane's
rendered width; there is no horizontal scroll offset today — a line just
renders as-is from column 0, clipped by the pane's `Rect` width.

- Bindings: `Ctrl-Left`/`Ctrl-Right` pan the view left/right. Bare
  `Left`/`Right` (parent/child move) and `Shift-Left`/`Shift-Right`
  (fold-all/unfold-all siblings, D15/D17) are both already taken; `Ctrl`+
  arrow follows the same modifier-escalation convention already used for
  `Ctrl-O`/`Ctrl-I` (jumplist) layered over plain `o`/`i` (now also
  `t` for spec 0114's override pane).
- Considered `<`/`>` as an unclaimed fallback if `Ctrl`+arrow doesn't reach
  the app in some terminal/multiplexer configuration — not adopted for v1;
  `Shift`+arrow already relies on similar terminal support and works fine
  in practice, so no reason to expect `Ctrl`+arrow to be worse.
- Not yet decided: exact pan step (e.g. a fixed column count vs. a fraction
  of the pane's visible width), clamping bounds (`0` on the left; on the
  right, likely the longest *currently visible* line's length minus the
  pane width, recomputed as the cursor/scroll position changes), and
  whether the fold-marker gutter (D3) stays pinned to column 0 while only
  the rendered text pans, or scrolls along with it.

### D25 — Positional-path notation, alongside the byte range

**Status:** Open — notation agreed; exact status-line layout and whether
very deep paths need truncation still TBD at implementation time.

Spec 0109's own User Interface section sketched a status-line "path"
(`.1.2`) without ever defining it precisely. Raised again as an
alternative/complementary way to identify the cursor node's range,
distinct from D13's `bytes[start..end]`: a byte range needs no schema
knowledge to *display*, but two different nodes can't be told apart from
it alone if you don't already know the tree shape; a **positional path**
identifies a node by its exact location in the tree instead, and does so
unambiguously with no schema knowledge required either.

- **Definition**: `/n_1/n_2/.../n_k`, a **slash-separated path**, where each
  `n_i` is the **1-based ordinal position of that level's node among its own
  parent's direct children, in document order** — *not* the field number.
  Field number was considered and rejected: a repeated field occurrence
  shares its field number with every other occurrence at the same level, so
  field number alone wouldn't be unambiguous; sibling position always is.
  This also means the path is computable purely structurally, from the same
  sibling-chain (`first_child`/`next_sibling`) `build_tree` (D1) already
  maintains — no field-number/tag inspection, no descriptor lookup needed.
- **Empty-path (root) notation**: the root/whole-document path is a lone
  `/`, with no segments after it — matching the familiar Unix filesystem-
  root convention. Every other path is "the root's `/`, plus one more `/n`
  segment per level" — uniform, no special-cased root format. Revises
  0109's own leading-dot sketch (`.1.2`): a dot-based path would sit
  directly adjacent to the status line's `.`-separated FQDN (e.g.
  `google.protobuf.DescriptorProto`), risking visual collision between the
  path's own `.` separators and the FQDN's; `/` avoids this entirely.
- **1-based**, matching the status line's own existing `Lx/total` (D13's
  neighbor) 1-based convention, for consistency within the same status
  line.
- **Display**: alongside `bytes[..]` (D13), not instead of it — e.g.
  `L5/3062  bytes[212..8841]  path /1/2  google.protobuf.DescriptorProto`.
  Exact column layout/ordering not yet decided.
- Noted in passing (not adopted, no action taken): this positional path
  would also be a valid, schema-independent key for identifying an
  override's target range (spec 0114) — 0114 sticks with the byte range as
  its cache/override key for now (already sufficient, no reason to
  complicate), but the path notation may be worth revisiting once spec
  0109's deferred "set of overrides" work needs a stable node identity
  that survives a re-render (a byte range can shift after an ancestor's
  own override changes its rendered length, if that ever becomes possible;
  a positional path, defined purely on the *original* wire structure,
  would not).

### D26 — Tab-completion with cycling for the command line

**Status:** Open — mechanism agreed; exact on-screen presentation of the
cycling state (e.g. a status-line hint, or just the buffer text changing)
still TBD at implementation time.

Motivated by spec 0114's `:type-as`/`:type-as-raw` command names (typing
either the command name or a full FQDN by hand is tedious), but designed
as general command-line infra, not ad hoc to that one feature — it also
benefits `:extract` (D21), and any future command added later.

Two independent things can be completed, at whichever position the cursor
sits in the command buffer: **(a)** the command name itself (the first
token), and **(b)** currently, only `:type-as`'s FQDN argument (the second
token, once the command name is resolved) — other commands' arguments
(e.g. `:extract`'s `<path>`) are left plain-typed, matching D21's existing
"no file browser, just like vim's own `:w <path>`" precedent; file-path
completion is not addressed by this entry.

- **Behavior**, modeled on vim's own `wildmenu`/`wildmode=longest,full`
  (a natural fit, since the command line already deliberately mimics vim —
  D21): the first `Tab` completes the current token to the longest common
  prefix of all matching candidates. If that prefix is still ambiguous
  (more than one candidate remains), each subsequent `Tab` — as long as no
  other key has been pressed in between — cycles forward through the full
  candidate list one at a time, replacing just that token, wrapping around
  after the last candidate. `Shift-Tab` cycles backward through the same
  list. Typing any other character, `Enter`, `Esc`, or `Backspace` ends the
  cycling state and returns to plain editing.
- **Templated, not ad hoc**: a single generic primitive, e.g.
  `fn complete_prefix<'a>(prefix: &str, candidates: impl Iterator<Item =
  &'a str>) -> Vec<&'a str>`, backs three call sites:
  1. `run_command`'s dispatcher itself — unambiguous-prefix execution at
     `Enter` time, with exact match always winning over prefix ambiguity
     (spec 0114 §7): typing a command's full name resolves to itself even
     when it's also a prefix of a longer command name (e.g. `:type-as` vs.
     `:type-as-raw`) — matching vim's own `:command` abbreviation
     convention and `argparse`'s prefix-matching, not a bespoke rule.
  2. Command-name Tab-completion, driven off the same single
     source-of-truth command-name registry already used by (1) — adding a
     command to that registry is the only step needed for it to get both
     prefix-dispatch and Tab-completion, automatically.
  3. `:type-as`'s FQDN-argument Tab-completion (spec 0114) — candidates are
     the same session-global, lexicographically-sorted FQDN list spec
     0114 §3.2/§6 already computes once and caches, reused here rather than
     recomputed. Structurally the same shape as the existing
     `protolens/src/complete.rs::complete_type_names` (a
     `clap_complete::ArgValueCompleter` used for the CLI's own `-t`/`--type`
     *shell* completion, outside the TUI) — not literally shared code
     (different completion frameworks: `clap_complete` vs. this TUI's own
     command-line editor), but the same matching semantics; worth keeping
     the two in sync if either changes.
- **No conflict with the override pane's own `Tab`** (spec 0114 §2):
  command-line editing (`App::command_buffer: Some(...)`, D21) and the
  override pane are mutually exclusive input modes — command-line mode
  already fully shadows every normal-mode key binding (D21), so its `Tab`
  binding and the override pane's focus-toggle `Tab` binding never compete
  for the same keypress.

### D27 — Drop the trailing `/` for message/group paths in the status line

**Status:** Implemented (2026-07-14)

D25 decorates a message/group node's positional path with a trailing `/`
in the status line (e.g. `/1/`), mirroring 0114 §3's own listing
convention for the override selection pane. In practice this decoration
doesn't add value — the status line already carries other cues (the
FQDN/`<raw / no type>` label right next to it) that make a node's
message-ness obvious — so it should be dropped: the status line always
shows the bare `positional_path` form (e.g. `/1`), same as every other
consumer of `positional_path` (0117's `path`/`path-field` origins, the
management pane's listing).

- Implementation note: this decoration is applied at exactly one site,
  `protolens/src/tui.rs`'s status-line-building code (the
  `ends_with('/')`/`push('/')` pair around the `path` variable, just before
  it's written into the status line). `override_pane.rs`'s own listing
  does **not** apply this decoration anywhere (checked directly — no
  `ends_with`/`push('/')` there), so 0117 §1's text describing the
  trailing slash as shared display logic between the status line and
  0114 §3's listing is itself slightly inaccurate; only the status line
  ever added it. Removing the one site fully resolves this, no other
  call site is affected.

### D28 — Mouse event dismisses the splash screen

**Status:** Implemented (2026-07-14)

The startup splash screen already treats every keypress as "dismiss and
proceed to the main view" (D22) — any key, not just a specific one, and
the dismissing key is **transparent**: `handle_key` sets `self.splash =
false` unconditionally at the top, then the same call keeps processing
the key as a real command (confirmed via `handle_key`'s own comment and
the `splash_dismissing_keypress_is_also_processed_as_a_command` test) —
it is not swallowed/consumed by the dismissal. A mouse event (click or
wheel) did not get this same transparency: `handle_mouse` was dispatched
independently of the splash screen's active/inactive state, so a stray
click/scroll while the splash is up was silently swallowed rather than
dismissing it. Fix: `handle_mouse` sets `self.splash = false`
unconditionally at the top, mirroring `handle_key`, then continues
processing the same event as a real mouse event — the first mouse event
that lands on the splash both dismisses it and acts on the newly-revealed
main view underneath, exactly matching the keyboard behavior above.

### D29 — Status pane title

**Status:** Implemented (2026-07-14)

The main/status pane currently renders with a plain `Block::bordered()`
and no `.title(...)` — every other bordered pane in the TUI (override
selection, override management, help overlay, splash) already has one
(`protolens/src/tui.rs`'s various `render_*` functions all call
`.title(...)`). Give the status pane a title too, along the lines of
`" status — hit F1 for help "`, matching the existing title style (a
short label, `F1`-for-help pointer, space-padded).

- Wording chosen at implementation time: `" Status — F1 for help "`, on the
  status pane itself (`chunks[1]`'s own `Block`, distinct from the main
  pane's `header`-titled block above it).

### D30 — Mouse support for the override selection and management panes

**Status:** Implemented (2026-07-14)

D4 gave the main pane mouse wheel scroll + click-to-select; the override
selection pane (0114 §2) and override management pane (0117 §3) never
got the same treatment — wheel/click events landing on either pane are
currently ignored (or fall through to whatever the main pane's own mouse
handler does with those screen coordinates, which is arguably worse than
simply doing nothing).

- **Wheel**: scroll the pane's own list (`override_scroll`/
  `manage_scroll`), same semantics as D4's main-pane wheel scroll —
  clamped to the list's own length, independent of the main pane's
  scroll position.
- **Click**: move the pane's own highlight (`override_highlight`/
  `manage_highlight`) to the row under the cursor, same semantics as D4's
  main-pane click-to-select.
- Only active when the relevant pane is open/focused — a click landing
  on the main pane while, say, the management pane is open should still
  act on the main pane if the main pane also has focus (mirrors 0114 §2's
  existing `override_focus`-gated `Tab`-toggle between the main pane and
  the override selection pane).
- **Implementation note**: neither pane currently persists its own render
  `Rect` as an `App` field (only `main_area` is, consumed by D4's
  `handle_click`) — `render_override_pane`/`render_manage_pane` compute a
  local `inner: Rect` at render time and discard it. Since the two panes
  are mutually exclusive (`override_target.is_some()` XOR `manage_open`,
  never both), a single shared stored `Rect` field would suffice for
  both.
- **Implementation as built (first pass)**: `handle_mouse` gated purely on
  the same focus conditions `handle_key` already checks (`manage_open`,
  then `override_focus`), not on the clicked screen coordinates — every
  mouse event was routed to whichever pane currently had keyboard focus,
  exactly mirroring how `handle_key` routes every keypress regardless of
  the (nonexistent) "position" of a key press. Wheel scroll called
  `move_override_highlight`/`move_manage_highlight` by one row (the same
  functions `j`/`k` already use — the pane's own render-time auto-scroll
  keeps the highlight in view, so there's no separate "scroll without
  moving the highlight" concept, matching the main pane's own D4 wheel
  behavior via `move_down`/`move_up`). Click hit-tests against the new
  `side_area` field, ignores rows past the pane's own `list_height` (the
  in-pane search line, when present), and — for the management pane —
  ignores clicks landing on a `ManageRow::Header` row.
- **Revised (2026-07-14 feedback)**: focus-gated routing meant a click in
  the main pane while a side pane was open both moved the highlighted row
  *and* left keyboard focus stuck in the side pane — no way to reclaim the
  main pane by clicking it — and wheel scroll ignored the mouse's actual
  hover position entirely. Two changes:
  - **Click always refocuses the pane it lands in.** A click in
    `main_area` clears `override_focus`/`manage_focus` (shifting keyboard
    focus back to the main pane) without closing whichever side pane is
    open; a click in `side_area` (re-)claims focus for that pane, same as
    before. This required giving the management pane its own `manage_focus:
    bool` field mirroring the override pane's pre-existing
    `override_focus` — previously the management pane had no independent
    focus concept at all ("always focused while open"), so `handle_key`
    gated on `manage_open` alone; it now gates on `manage_open &&
    manage_focus`, with `Tab` (both from inside the pane and from the main
    pane's own keymap) toggling it, exactly like the override pane's
    existing `Tab` behavior.
  - **Wheel scroll routes by hover position, not keyboard focus** — a new
    `App::rect_contains(area, col, row)` hit-test against `main_area`/
    `side_area` decides which pane's scroll handler a wheel event goes to,
    independent of which pane currently holds keyboard focus. `MouseEvent`
    already carries absolute screen coordinates, so this needed no new
    plumbing beyond the existing `main_area`/`side_area` tracking.
  - Click routing itself is unchanged from the first pass (still hit-tests
    `main_area`/`side_area`); only *which pane a click can end up giving
    focus to* changed, per the bullet above.

### D31 — `Ctrl-Z` suspends the process

**Status:** Implemented (2026-07-14)

Standard Unix job-control behavior (`SIGTSTP`) is currently unavailable
from within `protolens` — there is no key bound to it, and even if the
terminal driver forwarded a raw `Ctrl-Z` byte through crossterm's raw
mode, the process wouldn't leave the alternate screen/mouse-capture/raw
mode first, leaving the shell in a corrupted display state on suspend
(and again on `fg` resume). Add an explicit `Ctrl-Z` binding, checked
centrally the same way `quit_confirm` already is (at the top of
`handle_key`, ahead of every other dispatch, so it works uniformly
across every input mode — main/override/manage/command-line).

- On `Ctrl-Z`: call `restore_terminal()` (leave alt-screen, disable mouse
  capture, disable raw mode — the same cleanup already used on normal
  exit and in the panic hook), then raise `SIGTSTP` on itself.
- On resume (`SIGCONT`, i.e. `fg`): re-run `run()`'s startup sequence
  (`enable_raw_mode`, `EnterAlternateScreen`, `EnableMouseCapture`) and
  force a full redraw (`Terminal::clear()`) before returning to the
  event loop — the terminal's own screen contents are unknown/stale
  after a suspend/resume cycle (other programs may have run and printed
  to the same terminal in between).
- Unix-only (`#[cfg(unix)]`) — no `SIGTSTP` equivalent on Windows;
  `Ctrl-Z` would need to either no-op or be left unbound on that
  platform.
- Needs a signal-raising crate — `libc` or `nix` — neither of which is
  currently a `protolens` dependency (checked `Cargo.toml`); this adds a
  new dependency, worth flagging even though it's a small, common one.

- **Implementation as built**: as designed above. `libc` added as a
  `[target.'cfg(unix)'.dependencies]` entry (not an unconditional
  dependency) so it's simply absent from non-Unix builds. `App` gained a
  `should_suspend: bool` flag (mirroring `should_quit`'s own split): the
  centralized `handle_key` check (itself `#[cfg(unix)]`) only *sets* the
  flag, since actually raising `SIGTSTP` and redrawing needs the
  `Terminal` handle that only `run_loop` owns, not `App`; `run_loop`
  checks it right after `should_quit`, right where `should_quit` is
  itself checked, and calls a new `suspend(&mut Terminal<B>)` helper
  (`#[cfg(unix)]`, next to `restore_terminal`) that does the
  restore-terminal / `libc::raise(SIGTSTP)` / re-init / `terminal.clear()`
  sequence in one place. Placed the check ahead of `quit_confirm`'s own
  resolution (not after) so a pending quit confirmation survives a
  suspend/resume cycle unresolved, rather than being silently cancelled
  by the Ctrl-Z keypress itself.

### D32 — `Space` as an alias for `a` in the override management pane

**Status:** Implemented (2026-07-14)

`a` toggles the highlighted entry's active/inactive status in the
override management pane (0117 §3). Bind `Space` (`KeyCode::Char(' ')`)
as an alias for the same action — purely a convenience binding, no
behavior change beyond the existing `a` handler
(`self.overrides.toggle_active(self.manage_highlight); self.
render_overrides(self.first_node);`, spec 0118 §6). No conflict: `Space`
is not otherwise bound in `handle_manage_key`.

### D33 — Visual hint for overridden fields in the main pane

**Status:** Implemented (2026-07-14).

**Implementation as built**: styling choice resolved to bold, applied as
a single boolean state (not distinguishing the three override kinds) —
both confirmed with the author before implementing. A new
`App::footer_line_to_node: HashMap<usize, usize>` field mirrors the
pre-existing `line_to_node`'s maintenance exactly (same two update sites:
`App::new`'s initial build, and `splice_override`'s post-splice rebuild),
but maps a node's *closing*-brace line (`text_range.end - 1`) back to the
node, and only for nodes with children (a childless/scalar node's single
line is already covered by `line_to_node`). A new helper,
`line_has_active_override(&self, line_idx: usize) -> bool`, looks a line
up in `line_to_node` first, falls back to `footer_line_to_node`, and — if
a node is found — checks `resolve_active_override(idx).is_some()`. The
main pane's render loop applies `Modifier::BOLD` to every span on a line
whenever `line_has_active_override(line_idx)` is true, composed with the
existing `Modifier::REVERSED` cursor-row styling.

Currently, a node rendered under an active override looks identical to
one rendered under its natural/inherited type — the only way to tell is
to open the management pane and check which entries are active, or
recall which nodes were retyped during the session. Add some visual hint
directly in the main pane's own rendering, for any node whose subtree
root carries an active override (i.e. `resolve_active_override(idx).
is_some()` at the node itself — not merely "some ancestor happens to
also have an unrelated override," and not "this node's rendered type
happens to match what it would have had anyway via 0117's re-affirming
`activate` semantics").

- **Candidate styling**: bold (author's own suggestion) — cheap to apply
  via the existing `colorize`/`line_styles` pipeline, doesn't collide
  with the existing syntax-highlighting palette (which uses color, not
  weight). Alternatives worth considering at implementation time: a
  distinct color (risks colliding with existing token-kind colors), an
  inline marker character (e.g. a `*`/`†` prefix — risks visually
  competing with D3's fold marker and D25's positional-path notation,
  both of which already compete for the same left-hand gutter space), or
  a combination (bold + one of the above).
- **Scope**: applies only to the node that is itself the *direct* target
  of an active override (its own header/interior/footer lines) — should
  not cascade visual weight onto every descendant line merely because an
  ancestor is overridden (that would make deeply-nested overridden
  documents visually noisy without adding information; a descendant's
  own status is already independently checkable by moving the cursor
  onto it).
- Not yet decided whether this should also distinguish the three override
  *kinds* (`path` vs. `path-field` vs. `fqdn-field`, spec 0117 §1) or
  treat "has an active override, of whichever kind" as a single boolean
  state for styling purposes — leaning toward the latter (simpler, and
  the kind is already visible in the management pane) unless a concrete
  need for finer-grained visual distinction comes up.

### D34 — `Any`/`MessageSet` fields don't expand in the main pane

**Status:** Implemented (2026-07-14).

Reported behavior: an `Any`/`MessageSet` field renders as opaque bytes in
the main pane instead of expanding into the packed message's fields, even
though `DecodeRenderOpts`'s `expand_any`/`expand_message_set` both default
to `true` and protolens never overrides them off.

**Root cause**: expanding an `Any`/`MessageSet` field requires resolving
a type name (a type URL or extension name, only known at decode time) to
a `MessageDescriptor`. prototext-core exposes this as a pluggable,
caller-installed thread-local callback (`ANY_LOADER`, `set_any_loader`/
`clear_any_loader` in `prototext-core/src/serialize/render_text/mod.rs`)
— `decode_and_render`/`decode_and_render_indexed` only set
`EXPAND_ANY`/`HIDE_UNKNOWN`/`EXPAND_MESSAGE_SET` internally, they never
install `ANY_LOADER` themselves. Every other consumer in the repo installs
it around its own decode calls — the CLI's `install_any_loader`
(`prototext/src/run.rs:620-677`), the pyo3 bindings, the test suite — but
`protolens` never does (confirmed via a repo-wide grep for
`set_any_loader`/`ANY_LOADER` call sites). Without a loader installed,
`render_any_expansion` (and the MessageSet equivalent) silently fall
through — `ANY_LOADER.with(...)` returns `None` — and the field falls
back to raw-bytes rendering. `prototext decode` is unaffected because it
performs this installation step; protolens simply never added the
equivalent.

**Proposed fix**: add a protolens-specific loader-install function,
analogous to `prototext/src/run.rs`'s `install_any_loader`, called around
protolens's `decode_and_render_indexed` invocations. protolens's
`DescriptorContext` is always backed by an eager `DescriptorPool` (no
lazy-pool JIT-load path, unlike the CLI's), so the closure is simpler:
`ctx.pool().get_message_by_name(key).map(Arc::new)` for the `Any` case,
plus the MessageSet `"extendee_fqdn/field_number"` sentinel-key handling
the CLI's version already demonstrates.

**Implementation as built (first pass, later superseded)**: `decode.rs`'s
`install_any_loader(ctx: &DescriptorContext)` mirrored the CLI's version
but read `&DescriptorContext` (not `&mut`), since protolens's pool is
always eager — no lazy/JIT-load pre-step needed. It was bracketed around
both of the crate's `decode_and_render_indexed` call sites: `decode()`'s
initial paint and `splice_override`'s re-render on override apply.
Covered by a dedicated regression test,
`decode_expands_any_fields_via_installed_loader`.

**Superseded (spec 0120, 2026-07-14)**: this loader-callback approach
correctly fixed the reported symptom, but follow-up interactive testing
found the resulting expansion produced malformed navigation/cursor
positions for `Any`/MessageSet content (see spec 0120's Background for the
full root-cause writeup). Spec 0120 redesigned the mechanism entirely:
`expand_any`/`expand_message_set` are now disabled in protolens's own
`DecodeRenderOpts`, and protolens's own `render_overrides` pass detects
Any/MessageSet-shaped nodes and applies the equivalent expansion itself,
via the same override machinery a user would trigger by hand with `t`.
`install_any_loader`/`clear_any_loader`/`ANY_LOADER` and
`decode_expands_any_fields_via_installed_loader` were all removed as part
of that redesign — see spec 0120 for the current, actual mechanism this
decision's reported bug is now fixed by.

### D35 — Bold border indicates keyboard focus

**Status:** Implemented (2026-07-14).

Reported (2026-07-14 feedback, alongside D30's revision): once mouse
clicks could move keyboard focus between the main pane and a side pane
(D30), there was no visible sign of which pane currently held it.
Proposed and agreed: mirror the override/management panes' own existing
`override_focus`/`manage_focus`-driven border style (`Modifier::BOLD`)
on the main pane too.

**Implementation**: the main content block's border style is now
`Modifier::BOLD` exactly when neither side pane holds focus (`!
override_focus && !manage_focus`) — the main pane has focus precisely
when no side pane does, so no new flag was needed, just a new border-style
computation at the main block's construction site in `render`.
