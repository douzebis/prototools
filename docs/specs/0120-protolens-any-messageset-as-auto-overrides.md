## Background

Interactive testing against a real `boundary_proxy.Exemplar` document (with
nested `Any`-typed fields) surfaced three linked bugs:

1. Down-arrow navigation jumps backwards through Any-expanded content, with
   wrong positional paths.
2. Overriding the document root with raw/no-type shows a stray `1` token in
   the header, surviving even after deactivating the override.
3. Reactivating a real type on the root after having gone raw loses
   Any/MessageSet expansion on descendants (renders as raw bytes with a
   bogus field number `0`).

Bugs 2 and 3 were root-caused and fixed independently (spec 0119-adjacent
work, `field_name_for`/`splice_override` header-stripping and the G1
natural-type fallback) and are not this spec's concern. Bug 1 is.

**First (wrong) diagnosis**: Any/MessageSet expansion looked like a
legitimate "virtual node" design (`Sink::virtual_scalar`/
`begin_virtual_nested`, spec 0110 §3) that merely needed a doc-order
tiebreak fix in `build_tree` (`decode.rs`) when a virtual node's
`raw_range.start` ties with its own first child's. That fix
(`(raw_range.start, level)` sort key) was implemented and tested, but did
**not** fix the reported symptom — down-arrow still skips `type_url`.

**Corrected diagnosis**, confirmed by reading
`prototext-core/src/serialize/render_text/helpers/any_field.rs` and
`message_set_field.rs` in full: Any/MessageSet expansion should never have
produced a virtual node in the first place. What it actually does today
(`render_any_expansion`, `any_field.rs:187-297`):

- Emits `begin_nested` for the outer Any-typed field — real field number,
  real range, fine.
- Emits `virtual_scalar("type_url", ...)` for field 1 — **produces no
  `NodeSpan` at all** (`IndexingTextSink::virtual_scalar` is delegate-only,
  `sink.rs:1243-1254`). This is why down-arrow skips over `type_url`: there
  is nothing to land on.
- Emits `begin_virtual_nested("value", ...)` for field 2 — produces a
  `NodeSpan`, but with a **hardcoded `field_number: 0`** and a range that
  starts *after* field 2's own real tag+length prefix (`value_payload_start`,
  not `raw_range.start`) — i.e. field 2's own wire framing is silently
  discarded, which is what caused the doc-order tie the first (wrong) fix
  patched over instead of removing.

`message_set_field.rs`'s `render_message_set_expansion` is analogous and
worse: every repeated `Item` wrapper node gets the **same** placeholder
range `0..data.len()` regardless of repetition (`message_set_field.rs:
328-331`, an acknowledged coarse approximation), so distinct repetitions of
a MessageSet item are indistinguishable by range at all.

**Investigated and disproved**: a suspicion that `prototext` CLI's own
`decode` path has independent Any/MessageSet-detection logic protolens
should instead mirror. Traced the call chain
(`prototext/src/run.rs` → `prototext_core::render_as_text` →
`serialize::render_text::decode_and_render`) against protolens's own
(`decode_and_render_indexed`) and confirmed both are literal sibling
functions (`render_text/mod.rs:243`/`:309`) sharing the exact same
`render_message` → `render_len_field` → `render_any_expansion`/
`render_message_set_expansion` chain, generic over `Sink` — differing only
in which `Sink` impl is active (`TextSink` vs `IndexingTextSink`). There is
no separate Any/MessageSet logic anywhere else to mirror.

**Chosen design** (this spec): Any/MessageSet expansion is not a rendering
concept at all — "it simply results in overriding what would otherwise be
`bytes` into a specific message" (verbatim framing from review). So:

- Disable `expand_any`/`expand_message_set` in protolens's own
  `DecodeRenderOpts` at both its call sites (`decode()`, `splice_override`)
  — **zero `prototext-core` changes**; `prototext` CLI's own defaults
  (`expand_any: true, expand_message_set: true`) are untouched, since each
  caller owns its own `DecodeRenderOpts` value.
- With expansion disabled, `render_len_field` (`len_field.rs`) falls
  through to paths that are already correct and already used elsewhere:
  - An Any-typed field is schema-known (`Kind::Message(any_desc)`, `any_desc`
    being `google.protobuf.Any`'s own real 2-field descriptor:
    `type_url` string field 1, `value` bytes field 2) — ordinary
    `begin_nested`/`render_message` path (`len_field.rs:209-221`). Both
    `type_url` and `value` get real, correctly-ordered `NodeSpan`s "for
    free," via the same `scalar_field` logic every other field uses
    (`sink.rs:1087-1172`).
  - A MessageSet-typed field (`message_set_wire_format = true`, zero
    declared fields) falls to the unknown-LEN-field cascade
    (`len_field.rs:52-95`, spec 0097): each repeated group occurrence is
    probed and recursively rendered independently, giving each `type_id`
    (field 2, varint)/`message` (field 3, bytes) pair, inside each repeated
    group item (field 1), real per-repetition `NodeSpan`s — fixing the
    pre-existing "every Item shares `0..data.len()`" imprecision as a
    byproduct.
- protolens itself detects, during its existing `render_overrides`
  recursive pass (`tui.rs`), when a node is Any/MessageSet-*shaped*, and
  automatically computes-and-applies (via the existing, unmodified
  `splice_override`) an override on the relevant descendant node — exactly
  what a user would do by hand with `t`/`:type-as`, just automatic
  (seeded as a real, visible `OverrideEntry` the first time it's derived —
  see "Non-goals" below for why this diverges from the plan as originally
  drafted here). An explicit user override on that same node always takes
  priority.

This reuses `splice_override` (`tui.rs:1447-1691`) entirely unmodified: it
is already fully generic (extracts `payload_range` purely from
`old_span.raw_range`/`packed_record_start`, resolves the target via
`ctx.pool().get_message_by_name`, has no dependency on `is_message` or any
other property of the node being re-spliced) and reuses tested machinery
rather than adding a new mechanism.

### Recursion-complexity assessment (requested before drafting this spec)

The two shapes are structurally different and need separate handling —
this is the "intervening deeper in the nesting stack" complexity flagged
during review:

**Any** — one hop up, one hop sideways, from the *target* node's own
perspective. When `render_overrides` visits a node `idx` with
`field_number == 2` whose *parent* has `type_fqdn == Some("google.protobuf.Any")`,
the auto-derived target type is read from the sibling `field_number == 1`
node's own decoded string value.

**MessageSet** — two hops up, one hop sideways. When `render_overrides`
visits a node `idx` with `field_number == 3` whose *parent* is an
unknown/untyped node (`type_fqdn: None` — the auto-generated group-item
wrapper) whose own *parent* resolves (via `ctx.pool()`) to a
`message_set_wire_format`-flagged, zero-field descriptor, the auto-derived
target type is resolved as an *extension* of that grandparent's type,
keyed by the sibling `field_number == 2` node's own decoded varint value
(`extendee.get_extension(type_id)` — the exact lookup
`install_any_loader`'s existing MessageSet-path closure already performs,
`decode.rs:457-471`).

Both fit into `render_overrides`'s **existing** per-node visit and
**existing** sibling/child recursion (`tui.rs:1381-1427`) with no new
looping/pre-pass structure:

- `render_overrides` already recurses into every `is_message` child of a
  node in turn (its own `next_sibling` walk) — so for MessageSet, every
  repeated group-item child of the container is already visited on its own,
  one at a time, without any new repetition-handling code. The per-item
  `message`/`type_id` pair only needs a **single node's** two-hop-up check,
  not a lookahead from the container.
- The auto-derived type slots into the exact same fallback position
  `natural_type` already occupies (spec 0119 §G1): explicit active
  override > auto-derived Any/MessageSet type > `natural_type` > raw.
  `natural_type` already correctly returns `None` for both `value` (`Kind::
  Bytes`, not `Message`) and `message`/`Item` (no parent schema at all,
  since these are unknown-cascade fields) — no interaction/precedence
  conflict, the two fallbacks are mutually exclusive in practice.
- Nested Any/MessageSet (an Any's `value`, once auto-overridden to a
  concrete type, itself containing another Any-typed field) resolves for
  free: `splice_override` decodes the new subtree fresh (still under
  `expand_any: false`), and `render_overrides`'s own recursive walk visits
  the newly-spliced children next, re-running the same per-node detection
  uniformly — no separate recursive-detection pass is needed.

**Value/varint reading**: neither shape needs new low-level plumbing.
`extract::message_payload_range` (`protolens/src/extract.rs:76-98`,
already used by `splice_override`) already strips a scalar node's own tag
(+length, for `WT_LEN`) generically, regardless of wire type — reused
as-is to get `type_url`'s raw UTF-8 payload and `type_id`'s raw varint
payload. `prototext_core::helpers::parse_varint` (already imported by
`decode.rs`, fully `pub`) decodes the varint. No new dependency, no
`NodeSpan`/`Sink`/`IndexingTextSink` change.

**MessageSet-option query**: confirmed protolens does **not** need
`NodeSpan`/`IndexingTextSink` to convey `message_set_wire_format` at all.
protolens already depends directly on `prost_reflect` and already performs
equivalent pool lookups elsewhere (`parent_field`/`natural_type`, spec
0119; `install_any_loader`, `decode.rs:452-476`). The exact same query
`prototext-core`'s own (private, `pub(in super::super)`) `is_message_set`
uses (`message_set_field.rs:29-37`) —
`desc.descriptor_proto().options.as_ref().and_then(|o|
o.message_set_wire_format).unwrap_or(false)`, plus `desc.fields().count()
== 0` — is directly callable by protolens on a `MessageDescriptor` obtained
from its own `ctx.pool().get_message_by_name(fqdn)`, with no crate-boundary
issue. This resolves review caution #2 outright: no `IndexingTextSink`
plumbing is needed.

## Goals

- G1: Any-typed fields (`type_fqdn == Some("google.protobuf.Any")`) are
  recognized by protolens via FQDN match (per review caution #1). The
  `value` field (field number 2) is automatically overridden to the
  concrete message type named by the sibling `type_url` field's own
  decoded string (the FQDN is the substring after the last `/` — mirrors
  `any_field.rs`'s own `fields.type_url.rfind('/')` resolution,
  `any_field.rs:209-212`), whenever that type is resolvable in
  `ctx.pool()`. An unresolvable `type_url` leaves `value` rendered as
  plain bytes — no error, matches today's raw-fallback behavior elsewhere
  (e.g. `natural_type`'s own miss case).
- G2: MessageSet-typed fields are recognized by protolens via the
  `message_set_wire_format` option (per review caution #2), queried
  directly off the resolved `MessageDescriptor` — no `NodeSpan`/
  `IndexingTextSink` changes (per the assessment above). Each repeated
  group item's `message` field (field number 3) is automatically
  overridden to the concrete extension message type resolved from the
  sibling `type_id` field's own decoded varint value, treated as an
  extension field number on the MessageSet-typed container
  (`extendee.get_extension(type_id)`), whenever resolvable. An
  unresolvable `type_id` leaves `message` rendered as plain bytes.
- G3: cursor navigation (up/down/all movement) traverses Any/MessageSet-
  expanded content in correct document order, indistinguishable from
  navigating into a manually-overridden field of the same shape (fixes
  Bug 1). Falls out of G1/G2 for free — no `NodeSpan`/doc-order special
  casing survives this spec; `splice_override`/`build_tree` are already
  correct for manual overrides.
- G4: reactivating a real schema type on an ancestor after a raw/no-type
  override reliably re-derives Any/MessageSet auto-expansion on every
  affected descendant (fixes Bug 3, if it still reproduces once G1/G2 are
  in place — expected to, since `splice_override` always performs a
  genuine fresh recursive decode+`render_overrides` pass, but should be
  re-verified with a regression test under the new design rather than
  assumed).

## Non-goals

- Any change to `prototext-core` (`any_field.rs`, `message_set_field.rs`,
  `sink.rs`'s `virtual_scalar`/`begin_virtual_nested`, `NodeSpan` shape) —
  all remain exactly as-is. `prototext` CLI's own `expand_any`/
  `expand_message_set` defaults are untouched.
- ~~Persisting the auto-derived Any/MessageSet override as a real
  `OverrideEntry`~~ — **superseded during implementation**: the
  auto-derived type *is* seeded as a real `OverrideEntry` (`OverrideOrigin
  ::Path`, `auto: true`) the first time its origin is visited with no
  existing entry, deliberately, so it shows up as a normal, visible,
  user-editable/removable/renameable row in the manage pane rather than a
  silent dynamic fallback — and, since `to_yaml`/`from_yaml` make no
  distinction based on `auto`, it *does* round-trip through the YAML
  save/restore format like any other entry. The `auto: bool` field is what
  keeps this safe: it marks the entry as re-derivable rather than
  user-endorsed, so a subsequent `render_overrides` pass can *demote* it
  (silently stop honoring it for this pass, without touching `active`)
  if its governing ancestor's context changes such that the original
  derivation no longer holds — see "Demotion" in the `render_overrides`
  doc comment (`tui.rs:1556-1592`). Any explicit user action on the entry
  (`activate`, a manual `t`/`:type-as`) pins `auto` back to `false`,
  making it behave exactly like any other user-authored entry from then
  on. This is a stronger, more consistent design than the originally
  planned silent non-persisted fallback (spec 0119 §G1's `natural_type`
  precedent it was meant to mirror stays non-persisted, since it has no
  analogous demotion need).
- Changing how an explicit, user-authored override on the same node
  (Any's `value` / MessageSet's `message`) behaves — it always takes
  priority over the auto-derived type, same priority rule as
  `natural_type`.
- Any/MessageSet values inside a packed-repeated record (spec 0115) — out
  of scope; Any/MessageSet fields are always singular or (for MessageSet
  items) group-encoded, never a packable scalar kind, so this combination
  cannot arise.
- Re-litigating Bugs 2/3's already-applied, independent fixes (root header
  stripping in `field_name_for`/`splice_override`; G1's `natural_type`
  fallback) — kept as-is, though the two Phase-2 fixes specific to the old
  virtual-node design (`build_tree`'s `(raw_range.start, level)` doc-order
  tiebreak; `render_overrides`'s `field_number == 0` skip-resplice guard)
  are addressed under "Cleanup" below since they target a design this spec
  removes.

## Specification

### Detection helpers (`tui.rs`)

- `fn is_any_typed(&self, idx: usize) -> bool` — `self.tree[idx].span
  .type_fqdn.as_deref() == Some("google.protobuf.Any")`.
- `fn is_message_set_typed(&self, idx: usize) -> bool` — resolve
  `self.tree[idx].span.type_fqdn` via `ctx.pool().get_message_by_name`,
  then check `message_set_wire_format` + zero declared fields, mirroring
  `prototext-core`'s own `is_message_set` (not callable directly — it's
  `pub(in super::super)`, private to that crate — so this is a small
  independent replica in protolens, not a shared helper. This asymmetry
  is intentional and low-risk: both sides read the same well-known
  `MessageOptions` field via the same `prost_reflect` API, and a genuine
  future drift between the two copies is limited to this one small
  predicate).

### `auto_expand_type(&self, idx: usize) -> Option<String>` (`tui.rs`)

New fallback tier, consulted in `render_overrides` between the explicit
active override and `natural_type`:

```
match resolve_active_override(idx) {
    Some(explicit) => explicit,
    None => auto_expand_type(idx).or_else(|| natural_type(idx)),
}
```

Implementation, by `idx`'s own `field_number` and one/two hops up its
parent chain:

- `field_number == 2` and parent `is_any_typed`: find the sibling with
  `field_number == 1` (walk parent's `first_child`/`next_sibling` chain);
  read its raw payload via `extract::message_payload_range` (tag-only
  strip, `WT_LEN`), decode as UTF-8, resolve FQDN as the substring after
  the last `/`; return `Some(fqdn)` iff `ctx.pool().get_message_by_name
  (&fqdn)` resolves, else `None`.
- `field_number == 3`, parent has `type_fqdn: None` (unknown-cascade group
  item), and grandparent `is_message_set_typed`: find the sibling with
  `field_number == 2` under the same parent; read its raw payload via
  `extract::message_payload_range` (tag-only strip, `WT_VARINT`), decode
  via `prototext_core::helpers::parse_varint`; return
  `Some(extension_desc.full_name().to_string())` iff
  `ctx.pool().get_message_by_name(grandparent_fqdn)?.get_extension
  (type_id as u32)` resolves to a message-kind extension, else `None`.
- Any other `idx`: `None`.

**MessageSet tier 1, added during implementation (not anticipated above)**:
the repeated group-item wrapper itself (field 1, `WT_START_GROUP`) also
gets auto-overridden — to a synthetic, pool-wide-registered two-field
message type `protolens_internal.MessageSetItem` (`type_id` varint field
2, `message` bytes field 3; `decode::register_message_set_item`,
registered once per pool and reused by every MessageSet occurrence in the
document). This turns the wrapper from an unknown-cascade node into a
genuinely `is_message` one with real schema-declared field names, which is
what lets tier 2's `message` field resolve its own parent/grandparent
chain (`is_message_set_typed(grandparent)`) the same way regardless of how
deep the MessageSet container is nested — and gives the wrapper a display
name at all, since the unknown-cascade path has no schema name to draw on
(seeded as `"Item"` via spec 0119 §G4's per-entry `name` override,
matching `prototext-core`'s own native-rendering label for this wrapper).

### `render_overrides` changes (`tui.rs:1381-1427`)

- Drop the `span.field_number != 0` skip-resplice guard entirely (see
  "Cleanup" below) — with expansion disabled, no node this spec's design
  produces ever has a fabricated `field_number: 0` (the only remaining
  legitimate `field_number: 0` case is `Sink::malformed`'s
  `InvalidTagType`, per `NodeSpan`'s other documented meaning, spec
  0110).
- Widen the effective-type computation (currently `target.clone()` or
  `natural_type(idx)`) to the three-tier chain above.
- The child-recursion gate widens from `span.is_message` alone to
  `span.is_message || is_auto_expand_candidate(idx)` (as implemented — the
  original assumption above that the gate "stays `span.is_message`" turned
  out wrong): Any's `value` (field 2) and MessageSet's `message` (field 3)
  are still plain scalar bytes at the moment `render_overrides` first
  visits them, so a bare `is_message` gate never reaches them at all —
  they only become `is_message` *after* being auto-overridden, i.e. one
  pass too late. `is_auto_expand_candidate` is a narrow structural
  predicate (matches only these two field shapes, by field number and
  parent/grandparent type) so this widening cannot reopen the spec 0119
  bug where every plain scalar LEN-wire field got demoted to a raw record
  dump by being recursed into unconditionally.

### Cleanup: removal of the Phase-2 virtual-node-specific fixes (done)

Both were correct, tested fixes for the old (now-removed) virtual-node
design and became dead weight/misleading once that design was gone; both
were resolved as follows:

- `decode.rs`'s `build_tree`: the `(raw_range.start, level)` doc-order
  tiebreak was reverted precisely to plain `raw_range.start` — every
  `NodeSpan` now has a real, non-shared tag/length prefix, so no tie
  condition survives (`decode.rs:310-316`, comment updated to explain why
  ties can no longer occur rather than describing the removed virtual-node
  case).
- `decode.rs`'s test `build_tree_orders_virtual_any_wrapper_before_its_own_
  children` and `decode_expands_any_fields_via_installed_loader`: removed
  (their premise, a virtual wrapper node, no longer exists).
- `tui.rs`'s `render_overrides`: the `span.field_number != 0` guard and its
  explanatory comment were removed (superseded by the three-tier fallback
  chain and the `auto`-flag demotion mechanism above).
- `tui.rs`'s `splice_override_reactivating_root_type_still_expands_any_
  fields`: rewritten against the new auto-override mechanism's actual
  rendered output (asserts the root can be retyped raw and back to a real
  type without losing `Any` expansion on descendants — this is G4's
  regression coverage for the Any shape).
- `install_any_loader`/`clear_any_loader`/`ANY_LOADER` (formerly
  `decode.rs:452-476`): removed entirely, resolving the leaning stated
  when this spec was drafted — dead code once `expand_any`/
  `expand_message_set` are `false` at both call sites.

## Open Issues (resolved)

- `build_tree`'s doc-order tiebreak was reverted precisely to
  `raw_range.start` alone (no `level` secondary key) — see "Cleanup."
- `install_any_loader`/`clear_any_loader` and their call sites were
  removed entirely — see "Cleanup."
- `auto_expand_type`'s FQDN/extension-resolution logic was kept as
  separate small helpers (`is_any_typed`, `is_message_set_typed`,
  `find_sibling`, `read_string_field`, `read_varint_field`) rather than
  collapsed into one function — this reads more clearly given the
  MessageSet path's extra tier-1 synthetic-type step (see
  "Specification" above), which the original draft didn't anticipate.
- G4 (MessageSet auto-expansion re-derivation after ancestor retype) now
  has a dedicated fixture (`message_set_fixture`, `tui.rs`) and regression
  tests (`message_set_group_items_auto_expand_through_render_overrides`,
  `toggling_message_set_auto_override_off_and_on_sticks`,
  `deactivating_tier_1_demotes_the_still_active_tier_2_entry` — the last
  one covering the `auto`-flag demotion mechanism specifically, beyond
  what G4 itself asked for).

## Files changed

- `protolens/src/decode.rs` — `decode()`'s `DecodeRenderOpts` literal
  (`expand_any: false, expand_message_set: false`); `build_tree`
  doc-order tiebreak reverted to plain `raw_range.start`; removal of
  `install_any_loader`/`clear_any_loader`/`ANY_LOADER` and their call
  sites; new `MESSAGE_SET_ITEM_FQDN`/`register_message_set_item` (tier-1
  synthetic type registration); test updates per "Cleanup."
- `protolens/src/tui.rs` — `splice_override`'s `DecodeRenderOpts` literal
  (same two fields); new `is_any_typed`/`is_message_set_typed`/
  `is_auto_expand_candidate`/`find_sibling`/`read_string_field`/
  `read_varint_field`/`auto_expand_type` helpers; `render_overrides`'s
  fallback-chain widening, auto-seeding-as-`OverrideEntry`, and demotion
  logic; `splice_override`'s `wire_type`-preservation fix (`tui.rs:1905`,
  needed so `is_auto_expand_candidate`'s `span.wire_type` reads stay
  accurate across repeated splices); `field_number != 0` guard removal;
  test updates per "Cleanup," plus new MessageSet fixture/regression
  tests (G2/G4).
