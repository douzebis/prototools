; §1/§2 — extension_name/any_name, both reachable only through
; field_name (field_name: $ => choice(extension_name, any_name,
; identifier) has no other tokens of its own), so the blanket

; these patterns only narrow parts of them by last-match-wins.
;
; An extension name is left @attribute deliberately: `[acme.blade]: 3`
; names a field, and on the wire it is a tag like any other field's, so
; it belongs in the field-name color rather than in the type color it
; used to borrow.

; An Any key does hold a type name, and that half takes @type. The

; is chosen as the least-wrong default: enum-value-name identifiers are
; by far the more common case for a non-true/false/inf bare identifier
; in practice, and @constant is the closest standard capture
; semantically ("a named, unchanging value"). Declared first so the
; more specific patterns below can override it (tree-sitter's

; §7 (spec 0225 S12) — protolens's own `#@` annotations. The grammar
; gives them structure (see `annotation` in grammar.js) but stays
; keyword-blind; the vocabulary lives here, mirroring
; protolens/src/annotation.rs, because a query change needs no
; `tree-sitter generate`. protolens's
; `the_annotation_vocabulary_matches_the_grammars_captures` test fails
; if the two lists drift apart.
;
; Declared first: an annotation is still a comment, and every pattern
; below narrows a part of it. Anything the narrower patterns do not
; claim — the `#@` marker, the `;` separators, junk — stays comment
; gray, which is the right default for punctuation and for a keyword
; nobody has classified yet.

; An enum field's wire value, `Color(99)` or the packed
; `Color([1, 2])`. A number, wearing the number color, exactly like the
; symbolic name it stands for on the document half of the line. The
; parentheses go with it: they are one token, and a third split to make
; them punctuation would buy nothing the eye needs.
(annotation_enum_value) @number

; The declaration item — `[label] type [enum_value] [attribute] "="
; number`, e.g. `repeated int32 [packed=true] = 85` or `Type(5) = 5`.
;
; The label and the type both take @type: they are the two halves of
; one statement about what this field is, and together they are what
; the wire row's wire type borrows (spec 0225 S11), so splitting
; their colors would make that half of the tag depend on whether the
; field happened to be repeated.

; A shape name fills the same slot when there is no schema — an
; unknown or invalid field has nothing else to say what it is — so it
; takes the same color, and the wire row's wire type stays typed rather
; than going gray exactly where the bytes matter most. The INVALID_*
; names are not here: they are anomalies and the tiers below claim
; them.
;
; Seven names, not five: `bytes`, `string` and `message` are the three
; readings the renderer can give wire type 2, and they occupy one slot
; and answer one question, so they take one color (spec 0341).

; `[packed=true]` itself has no rule, and falls through to the comment
; color (spec 0267 S1, amended). It is not a *third* thing the field is:
; the label and the type name say what the field is, and packing says
; how the encoder chose to write it — the same kind of fact
; `pack_size: N` states two tokens later, in the same color.

; The field number, after the `=`. It is the document's field number,
; and the field-name color is what says so — the same color the name it
; belongs to wears at the head of the line, and the same the wire row's
; tag bytes borrow.

; happens to sit before an `=`. Shape names (varint, fixed64, fixed32,
; bytes, string, message, group) are deliberately absent: they are the
; document's own vocabulary quoted back, not an anomaly, and the @type
; pattern above is what claims them. `pack_size` is absent for the same
; reason (spec 0267 S2): it counts a record's elements, which is a fact
; about the encoding and not a complaint about it, so it falls through
; to the comment color every unclassified token takes.
