/// Read-only structural probe: walks a wire record via `render_message`
/// without producing any output, to answer "does this payload parse as a
/// well-formed message?" (spec 0097's unknown-LEN-field cascade Step 1)
/// without paying for tree construction (spec 0110 §2).
///
/// **The answer is no if rendering it would report anything invalid**
/// (spec 0266 S1). The classification is not this type's to invent:
/// `docs/prototext/annotation-format.md` already splits the annotation
/// vocabulary into invalid tokens, which mean a data-integrity issue, and
/// non-canonical ones, which round-trip exactly — and the case of the
/// token is the verdict, ALL CAPS disqualifying and lower case not. A
/// message from an eccentric but working encoder is still a message; a
/// record whose framing contradicts itself is not.
///
/// Rather than enumerate the anomalies that disqualify — a list that was
/// wrong at every point in its life, because anything nobody enumerated
/// was accepted silently — every payload type reaching this sink is
/// destructured **exhaustively**, so that a new anomaly stops the build
/// here until somebody classifies it (spec 0266 S3).
///
/// Always assumes its argument is a message being probed for plausibility.
/// LEN-delimited fields are treated as opaque bytes and never recursed into
/// (`treat_len_as_opaque` returns `true`) — a LEN field's own length prefix,
/// already bounds-checked by `render_message` before dispatch, is all the
/// validation needed at this level. GROUP fields still get mandatory
/// recursion (they have no length prefix, so their extent can only be
/// found by parsing through them), and anything invalid found inside a
/// nested group rolls up into this same counter automatically, since the
/// same `&mut ProbeSink` is threaded through every recursion level
/// (spec 0110 Open Issue #1).
///
/// Never mutates any shared render-mode thread-local state (`tracks_level`
/// returns `false`): it is a read-only helper that may be invoked from the
/// middle of an in-progress outer render (typically a `TextSink` pass), and
/// must not disturb that render's own state.
///
/// Spec 0312 carves out exactly one exception, and it is the only one:
/// a payload cut by the capture running out, after it has already shown
/// [`MIN_FIELDS_BEFORE_A_FORGIVEN_CUT`] complete fields, is still a
