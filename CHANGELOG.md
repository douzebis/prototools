# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **protoscan is a Rust binary** (spec 0407), with the same command line
  and output, built on a new scanner crate, `fdp-scan`, which the
  `fdp_scan_lib` Python extension now wraps. It gains bash completion that
  handles `:`, `=` and quotes (spec 0406), zsh and fish completions, a man
  page and `--version`. Install it with `cargo install protoscan`; the
  Python package `protoscan` is no longer published.

### Deprecated

- **protoscan `--proto_out`**: use `--proto-out`, spelled like every other
  long option. The old spelling still works, prints a warning, and will be
  removed in a later release.

### Fixed

- The Python extensions' type stubs name their real module: the
  `prototext-codec` stub declared `register_schema` as returning an
  undefined `prototextSchemaHandle`, and the `prototext-graph` stub lacked
  `build_fds_index`'s `ext_to_file` parameter.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-10-10

The first release with one version for every tool, crate and Python
package, from github.com/douzebis/prototools.

### New

- **protolens**, an interactive terminal browser for binary protobufs:
  type inference with per-range heat cues, the raw bytes behind every line,
  overrides, search, export, and guided scripts.
- **prototext**: `is-canonical`; whole-file scoring; a truncated message
  says which fields it is missing, and a truncated field keeps its declared
  type.
- **reproto**: reads a blob as a root, and applies the FDP plugin at every
  parse.
- **protoscan**: asks the schema where a descriptor ends.

### Changed

- Bash completion for prototext and protolens no longer depends on bash's
  word splitting: arguments containing `:` or `=`, quoted paths and escaped
  spaces complete correctly, and a completion never corrupts the line.
- Scoring: a bool is any varint, and a packing mismatch scores net zero.
- The builds need no `protoc` or `reproto`: the descriptors and the WKT
  scoring graph they used to generate are committed.

## 0.2.1 — 2026-06-19

prototext, protoscan and reproto, as published on crates.io and PyPI.
